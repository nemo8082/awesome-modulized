# awesome-modulized
Awesome (stable released) default config modulized.
This is the default configuration of Awesome 4.3. But it is modularized!
The default one given in documentation isn't modularized at all. 
And it is hard to understand. That probably not perfect but this version of the 
deafult config is easier to understand and it is a better place to start with (imo).
